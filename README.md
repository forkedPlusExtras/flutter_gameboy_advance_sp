# Flutter Gameboy

> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BeX6jx8bqE">See demo video</a> of my Flutter Hackathon entry for Retro Theme! #Hack20

Never held a Gameboy console? This app simulates the look of a Gameboy Advance SP. It can load/unload cartridges which are Widgets in the app's source code! The system controls (d-pad, buttons) implementation are dynamic, so every cartridge controls do different things!

## Cartridges available
- Music Player
- Flutter Counter

## Web Version (unstable)
https://mayoljonathan.github.io/flutter_gameboy_advance_sp
> Not fully responsive and layout breaks
